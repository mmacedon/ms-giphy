* [x] Website is dynamic. It can be viewed finely with all mobile devices
* [x] Images are dynamic. They change size accordingly.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
  The most difficult part about coding this app was setting up the server
  as none of the tutorials seemed to work on my machine. There was much online
  searching and manipulating files and to get the server to run the web app.
  Figuring out how to get the server to work consumed much of the time working
  on the app and testing it.
